## Biography 

I am in the last semester of my BA in Cultural Studies and WOrld Cinemas. I work at CJLO, the concordia radio station, and make short films. I am starting to do sound experiments, which are centred around processing data from the body and translating it into sound wave freqencies. I also write poetry, and perform it on occasion. I am planning on starting my masters in interdisciplinary studies at concordia next fall. 

## My Research Project

The research I have been doing is looking at the representation of injury and sickness in sports films, and live sports casting. I have been drawing on theories of the body, including bio-politics and elaine's scarry's discusion of the body in pain. I am hoping to use an interdisciplinary approach in my research, drawing on critical theory, medical studies, and film theory to understand the role of physical pain and injury in discourses of the body.
