Annotation: The panel discussion “Queer Infrastructures: Digital Intimacies, Spaces, Affordances and Collaboration” incorporates four authors to discuss “Queer OS”: “an operating system in which the historical, sociocultural, conceptual phenomena that currently shape our realities…[are understood as] mutually constitutive with sexuality and with media and information technologies…”. Each author brings a different element of queer reading into the discourse, from architecture, to digital production, to nightlife, and even to the body. The group then attempts to draw the connection between interior architectural spaces and maps of digital spaces, connecting those to the very makeup and design of the inner body: drawing the varying themes together under the concept of “infrastructure”. Ultimately, the abstract calls for a mobilization of queer histories in order to build future online platforms that resist dominant ideologies and their call for full public access in online spaces.

Annotation: The article  “Sharing Surgical Scars: Social Networks and the Many Gendered Meanings of Mastectomy” performs an analysis of the gendered and sexualization connotation of the breast, in order to deconstruct its meaning in the acts of gender affirmation surgery and mastectomy for breast cancer. The groups of women, non-binary, and trans-masculine people articulate a distinctly different relation to surgical modification of the female body, often times through collective action on social media platforms. The example of the “Flattopers” movement demonstrates the affirmation of body positivity for women opting out of reconstructive breast surgery post mastectomy. Images of trans and queer fashion have provided visibility for flat-chested femmes: reconstructing the meaning of femininity through alternative discursive models of the body and its cultural signification.

Annotation: Audacity is an online multilingual audio recording and editing software, that runs on an open source platform. It allows anyone to record live audio, or computer feedback, then cut, copy, or splice sounds together. The software also allows the author to change the speed or pitch of the recording. The program was developed by a group of volunteers, and distributed under the GNU General Public Liscence in 2000. The coding language used is C++, making it easily accessible to anyone with basic coding knowledge on this platform. In digital multimedia projects, Audacity offers a platform for manipulating audio data to potentially experiment with the very texture and quality of the sound.
